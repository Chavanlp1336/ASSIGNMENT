                    Early life
                    Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 into a Telugu-Marathi speaking family in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.[7][8][9] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[10] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[11] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[12]
                    
                    Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[12] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.[13]</p>
